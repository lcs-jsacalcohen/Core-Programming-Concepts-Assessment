 # Question 2
 
 Imagine you're creating software for a book publisher.
 
 Your app needs to track the following information for a given book:
 
 - Book name: the name of the book being published
 - Copies sold: the number of copies sold
 - Author name: the name of the book's author
 - Selling price: the suggested price that bookstores should sell the book for
 - Year published: the year that the book was first published in

 **For each piece of information above, create a variable or constant (whatever is more appropriate).**
 
 **Then, use `print()` statements to briefly explain why you chose to use a variable or a constant for each piece of information above.**
 
 */
// Answer question 2 below
let bookName = "biography"; print()
//I chose a constant because the name of a book is not going to change
var copiesSold = "250_000"; print()
// This is a variable because we dont know exactly how many people are going to purchase the book
let bookAuthor = "joseSacal"; print()
// this is a constant because the author wont change
var price = "49.99"; print()
// this is a variable because the prince may varie do to the coustomers purchase
let yearPublished = "2018"; print()
//this is a constant because the year is not going to change
